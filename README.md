This file pairs with my YouTube video: https://youtu.be/pRGAdl5L-xY

The goal of the video was a very quick walkthrough of getting someone set up and running using Visual Studio,

Disclaimer:
This is my first YouTube video - I meant it to be simple and quick.  This repo should be viewed the same: simple.
